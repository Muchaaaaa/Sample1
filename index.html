    <h1><b>NETWORKING AND DATA COMMUNICATION</b></h1>
        <p>
            A <b>Network</b> is a collection of independent entities that are arranged in such a manner
             as to exchange data,information or resources.A computer network is a collection of computers linked 
             together using transmission media for the purpose of communication and resource sharing.
             <br>
             Transmission media is any physical or non-physical link between two or more computers in which a signal 
             can be made to flow from source to destination.Some of the shared resources include programs,printer,

                <h2><b>TERMS USED IN DATA COMMUNICATION</b></h2>
                    <p>
                        -<b>Data signal</b>-Voltage level in the circuit representing flow of data.Data signals 
                        can either be analog or digital in nature.Analog data is made up of continuous varying waveform.
                        Digital data is made up of non-continuous discrete waveform.
